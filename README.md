# VOLUME CONTROL BY HAND GESTURE

# DESCRIPTION

Hand Gesture Volume Control System is a computer vision project developed using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It allows users to control the system volume using hand gestures. The webcam detects the hand and identifies the thumb and index finger positions. The distance between these fingers is calculated and mapped to the system volume level. When the fingers move closer, the volume decreases, and when they move apart, the volume increases. This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking and touchless human-computer interaction.
